{{see also|Second Azarov Government}}
On 28 January, Prime Minister [[Mykola Azarov]] tendered his resignation to a special emergency session of the Verhovna Rada called by President [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. The President subsequently accepted the resignation and signed a decree dismissing the Cabinet, which decree would not take effect until the Verhovna Rada approved a new Cabinet. Hence the [[Second Azarov Government]] continued as a caretaker government.<ref name=EN28114AA/> Azarov was replaced by Deputy Prime Minister [[Serhiy Arbuzov]].<ref name=EN28114AA>[http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/28/ukrainian-parliament-votes-to-scrap-controversial-anti-protest-laws/ Ukrainian parliament delays vote on amnesty law until Wednesday], [[Euronews]] (28 January 2014)</ref> Hours after resigning, Azarov fled the country to [[Austria]] with no intent on returning in the near future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/140131/ukraine-ex-pm-azarov-jets-austria |title=Ukraine ex-PM Azarov jets to Austria |publisher=GlobalPost }}</ref>

[[Oleh Tyahnybok]], leader of [[Svoboda (political party)|Svoboda]], stated that Mr. Azarov had resigned in the face of a looming no-confidence vote that he was bound to lose. In addition, the [[Party of Regions]] joined with opposition deputies to repeal 9 of the 12 [[Dictatorship laws in Ukraine|anti-protest laws]] passed on 16 January.  Opposition deputies compromised by approving more limited versions of some of the repealed restrictions. For example, a provision for criminalizing the destruction of monuments was reinstated, but was limited only to monuments of fighters against fascism, such as those commemorated in World War II statues. Destruction of statues of Lenin would no longer be a criminal offence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/world/europe/ukraine-prime-minister-resign.html?_r=0|author=Andrew E.

On 29 January some 23 cars with western Ukrainian license plates were set on fire in Kiev, and on the 31st, the car of an employee of the Canadian embassy in Ukraine. Taking credit for these acts was a newly formed terrorist group called ''Red Sector'' (a play on the name of the right-wing group ''Right Sector''). In a written statement of admission, Red Sector said: "Yes, today we burned many cars of the idiots who came to Kyiv, shat on it and think they are masters. There will be no revolution!

On 7 August 2014 a part of the barricades and tents were removed after clashes between activists and the [[Kyiv-1 Battalion|Kyiv-1]] and [[Kyiv-2 Battalion|Kyiv-2]] [[National Guard of Ukraine|National Guard]] battalions. On the morning of 8 August 2014 an agreement was made between part of the Maidan Self-Defense and the Mayor's office for the release of [[Khreshchatyk]] Street in exchange for the release of prisoners captured by the [[National Guard of Ukraine|National Guard]] in preceding days. Mayor [[Vitali Klitschko]] called on [[Kiev|Kyiv]] residents to come help clean-up Maidan on the morning of 9 August. That day, instead of just clearing [[Khreshchatyk]] as promised, almost the entire Maidan was hastily cleared by some [[Kiev|Kyivans]] and hired plainclothes men. The dismantling continued until 10 August, when not a single residential tent remained.

Despite [[Vitali Klitschko]] promising to allow the stage to remain, the [[Kyiv-1 Battalion]] came to dismantle the stage. It was partially re-assambled into working-order by activists and [[Kiev|Kyivans]] at noon on 10 August.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/217392.html Fire put out, road cleared in Khreschatyk, Independence Square in Kyiv], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (7 August 2014)</ref><ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/217262.html Barricades and tents burning on Kyiv's Maidan], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (7 August 2014)</ref>
